# League of Legends Discord Bot

*• Innovative • Scalable • Real-Time*

## Project Overview

The **League of Legends Discord Bot** is a high-performance, data-driven application designed to seamlessly integrate with Discord and the Riot Games API. Built with modern Python best practices and asynchronous programming paradigms, this bot dynamically retrieves and displays League of Legends account statistics, ranking data, and team configurations directly within Discord channels. With a modular, object-oriented design and persistent database integration, it is engineered for scalability and rapid feature expansion.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time API Integration:**  
  Leverages Riot Games’ API to fetch up-to-date summoner data, rank information, and champion mastery statistics, ensuring users always have the latest insights.

- **Dynamic Team and Player Management:**  
  Implements robust object-oriented design to create and manage team objects, each containing five player objects with comprehensive data on rank, summoner name, and top three mastery champions.

- **Persistent Data Storage:**  
  Utilizes SQLite for efficient local storage with the potential for scaling to PostgreSQL or MySQL, making it perfect for both small projects and enterprise-level applications.

- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven:**  
  Built on the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/) framework, the bot ensures responsive, non-blocking interactions even in high-traffic channels.

- **Modular and Extensible Architecture:**  
  Designed with clean code practices and modularity, facilitating future enhancements like additional commands, advanced analytics, or a dedicated web dashboard.
